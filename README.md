# GENEVA DRIVE

CAD model of a geneva drive designed in Fusion 360. 

The geneva drive has a very fascinating design - for every full rotation of the red gear, the green gear performs a fraction of a rotation. The number of slits present on the green gear dictate the magnitude of each of its fractions of rotation. You can imagine that if you design a geneva drive with 10 slits, then you can associate the integers 0 through 9 between each of the slits to get a counter. For example, those counters were used in the past to display departure times of trains at train stations.
